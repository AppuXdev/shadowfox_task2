*Air Quality Index (AQI) Analysis in Delhi*
This project presents a detailed analysis of Delhi’s air pollution using historical AQI data. It focuses on identifying key pollutants, seasonal trends, and geographic patterns. A multi-class classification model was built to predict AQI categories, achieving an accuracy of 75.4%.
#  Folder Structure
- `data/`  
  Contains the cleaned AQI dataset (`delhiaqi.csv`) used for analysis.
- `excel/`  
  Stores Excel files used for initial inspection and manual summaries.
- `image/`  
  Includes visual outputs such as classification reports and pollutant trend plots.
- `notebook/`  
  Contains the Jupyter Notebook (`shadow project 1.ipynb`) and this README.
# Key Objectives
- Analyze pollutant levels (CO, NO, NO₂, O₃, SO₂, PM2.5, PM10, NH₃)
- Explore seasonal and temporal variations in AQI
- Build and evaluate a classification model to predict AQI categories
#  Techniques Used
- Data cleaning and preprocessing with Pandas
- Statistical analysis and correlation mapping
- Visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn
- Multi-class classification with model evaluation (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score)
# Outcome
The model performs well on moderate and good AQI predictions, with slightly lower recall for poor AQI levels. This analysis supports data-driven strategies for pollution control and public health awareness in Delhi.
#  Tools & Libraries
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Excel (for initial data inspection)
